This is a website and service for notifiying readers of the comic Prague Race when the comic updates and a new page comes out.

Feeds are often a few minutes late - they can get to fifteen minutes of delay. They may require copy-pasting URLs or code, and it's ugly
and error-prone. They're uncomfortable and constricting, making you feel in a hurry to see everything and never miss a single thing. They
offer very limited info; other than the title, date, and "today's news" that Leppu seems to have dropped, you know nothing about the update.

PRUN aims to fix all of that. It is designed in a way to reduce stress on the servers while maintaining quick update recognition: Under 120
seconds. PRUN doesn't require an external program to be downloaded like most readers do, or even a site visit. Instead, it offers emails - 
you can get notified by an email every time Prague Race updates, allowing you to be alerted whether on desktop, laptop, or mobile. The
PRUN website and emails contain all the information you'd want about the update: Exact time and date, title, the panel itself, and the
"news". The site is very easy to use and allows you to subscribe to emails, view update details, and even boasts Google Chrome desktop
notifications.

_PRUN - Prauge Race updates, everywhere, anytime._
